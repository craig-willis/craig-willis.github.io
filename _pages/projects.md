For the past 10 years, I've worked primarily as a research assisstant or research programmer on grant-funded research and research infrastructure projets. This page presents a summary of the grant-funded projects that I've been involved over the years.

Since 2017, I've worked as a research programmer and technical project manager on the NSF-Funded [Whole Tale](https://dashboard.wholetale.org) project (Award [1541450](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1541450)). We are building an open-source platform for reproducible computational research that enables researchers to publish the computational arfifacts associated with peer-review publications.

From 2018 until my departure from NCSA in 2020, I served as the UIUC PI of the NSF-funded CHEESE project (Award [1820608](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1820608)). [Cyber Human Ecosystem of Engaged Security Education](http://docs.cheesehub.org/) was an NSF-funded initiative to develop a learning ecosystem for cybersecurity education based on the NDS Labs Workbench platform (below).

From 2016 - 2019, I worked as a research programmer on the ARPA-E funded Transportation Energy Resources from Renewable Agriculture Phenotyping Reference Platform  or [TERRA-REF](https://www.terraref.org/) project. I worked on the computational pipeline and data access infrastructure as well as metadata and information organization aspects of the project.

From 2015 - 2019, I served as a research programmer and technical coordinator (2016 - 2019) for the [NDS](http://nationaldataservice.org/) initiative. NDS was a consortium of data providers, academic libraries, publishers, and cyberinfrastructure providers intended to improve research data access and reuse. We developed the NDS Labs Workbench platform, a system intended to provide low-barrier computational access to research data via container-based environments. This platform was ultimately used as part of the TERRA-REF infrastructure as well as the basis for the CHEESE-Hub platform.

I worked as a research assistant on the NSF-funded III project (Award [1217279]()) conducting research on the temporal aspects of relevance. This includes the exploration of techniques for incorporating temporal information from queries and document collections into general-purpose retrieval models.

<img align="left" src="/images/htrc.jpg" alt="HTRC" style="width: 20px; margin-right: 10px"/> <b style="font-size: 14pt; vertical-align: middle">Hathi Trust Research Center</b>

The HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC) enables computational access for nonprofit and educational users to published works in the public domain and, in the future, on limited terms to works in-copyright from the HathiTrust. The HTRC is a collaborative research center launched jointly by Indiana University and the University of Illinois, along with the HathiTrust Digital Library, to help meet the technical challenges of dealing with massive amounts of digital text that researchers face by developing cutting-edge software tools and cyberinfrastructure to enable advanced computational access to the growing digital record of human knowledge.
