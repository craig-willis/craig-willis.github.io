I am a research programmer at the [School of Information Sciences](https://ischool.illinois.edu) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I received my PhD in August 2020. My [dissertation research](http://hdl.handle.net/2142/108468) focuses on changes to the peer review process to support the verification and dissemination of reproducible computational research artifacts. My research interests span the topics of computational reproducibility; research data access; systematic organization of information; and information storage and retrieval. 

I previously worked as a Senior Research Programmer for the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), where I contributed to a number of grant-funded [projects](/projects). I received my MLS from UNC Chapel Hill and undergraduate degree in Geography from the Univeristy of Colorado at Boulder. Before graduate school I worked as a software engineer for companies including ProQuest and Sony Recording Media.
